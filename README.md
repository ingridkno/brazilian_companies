Suppose you are keen to open your own business in the area of acoustics, audio, or vibration.

A lot of questions can come over your head: 
* Where should I open my business? 
* In my core business, what are the main activities exercised in my region?
* Based on the existing company data, how has been their behavior to succeed? Are they specialists or diversifying ones?

In Brazil, we have open data of companies from all over the country. The idea is to filter and analyze these companies that have activities involving:
* Audio
* Acoustics
* Vibration

By doing so, we could use artificial intelligence. For example, it is possible to show a map with similar companies and their geolocalization. Also, by knowing their opening date, the oldest ones could be a reference for success and guide people to choose the best activities for their own business.

The goal is to understand more about the brazilian market, and our beloved areas of audio, acoustics, and vibration!
